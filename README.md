AnyBoneSegmenter is a deep learning-based medical image segmentation model specialized in accurately segmenting diverse bone structures across MRI and CT modalities.

SegmentAnyBone is a foundational model-based bone segmentation algorithm adapted from Segment Anything Model (SAM) for MRI scans. It can segment bones in 17 body parts with high precision.

🌟 Features
✅ Multi-modality support: Works with both MRI and CT scans.

✅ 17 Body Parts Segmentation: Covers major anatomical regions.

✅ SAM-based Architecture: Leverages the power of Segment Anything Model.

✅ Medical-Grade Accuracy: Optimized for clinical use cases.
