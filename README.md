# ü¶¥ AnyBoneSegmenter 


**AnyBoneSegmenter** is a deep learning-based medical image segmentation model specialized in accurately segmenting diverse bone structures across **MRI** and **CT** modalities. 

**SegmentAnyBone** is a foundational model-based bone segmentation algorithm adapted from **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** for MRI scans.

## üåü Features
- ‚úÖ **Multi-modality support**: Works with both **MRI** and **CT** scans
- ‚úÖ **17 Body Parts Segmentation**: Covers major anatomical regions
- ‚úÖ **SAM-based Architecture**: Leverages the power of Segment Anything Model
- ‚úÖ **Medical-Grade Accuracy**: Optimized for clinical use cases
