# AnyBoneSegmenter
AnyBoneSegmenter is a deep learning-based medical image segmentation model specialized in accurately segmenting diverse bone structures across both MRI and CT modalities.

SegmentAnyBone is a foundational model-based bone segmentation algorithm adapted from Segment Anything Model (SAM) for MRI scans. It can segment bones in the following 17 body parts:
Humerus | Thoracic Spine | Lumbar Spine | Forearm | Pelvis | Hand | Lower Leg
Shoulder | Chest | Arm | Elbow | Hip | Wrist | Thigh | Knee | Foot | Ankle
